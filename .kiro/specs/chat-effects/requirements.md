# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the Effect TypeScript library into our chat application. Effect is a functional programming library that provides powerful tools for handling asynchronous operations, managing side effects, and implementing robust error handling. By adopting Effect, we aim to improve code quality, reliability, and maintainability across the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Effect for API calls and asynchronous operations, so that I can handle errors and edge cases more effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use Effect to handle success and failure cases in a type-safe manner.
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate retry mechanisms using Effect's retry capabilities.
3. WHEN multiple API calls are needed THEN the system SHALL use Effect's composition capabilities to manage dependencies between calls.
4. IF an API call fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information to help with debugging.
5. WHEN performing asynchronous operations THEN the system SHALL use Effect to ensure proper resource cleanup.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Effect with React components, so that I can manage component state and side effects more predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a React component needs to fetch data THEN the system SHALL provide Effect-based hooks for data fetching.
2. WHEN a component is loading data THEN the system SHALL handle loading states consistently using Effect patterns.
3. WHEN a component unmounts THEN the system SHALL ensure all Effect operations are properly canceled.
4. IF data fetching fails THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling in components.
5. WHEN a component needs to refetch data THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to invalidate and refresh data.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Effect for state management in the chat application, so that state updates are more predictable and easier to debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating application state THEN the system SHALL use Effect to ensure updates are performed in a controlled manner.
2. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL provide proper error handling for failed state transitions.
3. WHEN multiple state updates are needed THEN the system SHALL use Effect to manage the sequence of updates.
4. IF a state update fails THEN the system SHALL be able to roll back to a previous valid state.
5. WHEN debugging state issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about state transitions.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to gradually migrate existing code to use Effect, so that we can adopt the library incrementally without disrupting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Effect THEN the system SHALL provide compatibility layers for existing Promise-based code.
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the system SHALL use Effect by default for all asynchronous operations.
3. WHEN refactoring existing code THEN the system SHALL provide patterns and utilities to simplify migration to Effect.
4. IF issues arise during migration THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms to ensure application stability.
5. WHEN testing migrated code THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to simplify testing Effect-based code.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Effect for validation and error handling, so that I can improve the robustness of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating user input THEN the system SHALL use Effect to handle validation in a composable way.
2. WHEN handling form submissions THEN the system SHALL use Effect to manage the validation and submission process.
3. WHEN storing user preferences THEN the system SHALL use Effect to ensure data consistency.
4. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages to guide users.
5. WHEN running on devices with limited resources THEN the system SHALL use Effect's optimization capabilities to maintain performance.
